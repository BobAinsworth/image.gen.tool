To change this image:
            1) Upload your new .png file into the images folder.
            2) Update the src= value below to match the file name.
               Example:
                 src="images/top-image-portrait-1.png"
            3) Commit and publish.

            Tip: Use images that look good in a square crop (1:1). The CSS
            will keep the container square and crop the edges if needed.
